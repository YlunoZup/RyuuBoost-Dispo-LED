# Disclaimers/Hazards
Disposable vapes generally use Li-ion batteries without any protection circuitry. Short circuits could dissipate uncontrolled amounts of power, causing personal injury and/or property damage. Any work done on these vapes is done at your own risk.

It has been determined that there are multiple circuit revisions of these vapes, which may have incompatibilities that could result in device damage if versions are mismatched. Verify connections and firmware compatibility before proceeding with any modifications.

Additionally, vape juice/"e-liquid" can contain high concentrations of nicotine, which is absorbed through skin. Handling of the vape's internals should be done with gloves until the internal parts are cleaned of juice and/or residue.
